Using python 3.5.3, a list of modules and their versions
can be found in module_list.txt

*** For all problems, just run 'python exer*.py' where * is the problem number. ***
Required outputs should be print to the terminal emulator, or draw to graphical
output through matplotlib.

P.S:
./dataSet.npy contains binary numpy files for problem 1.
./ccHistStuff.py contains Claudio's stat box class to be used for problems.
