Using Python 3.5.3
Includes ccHistStuff.py for showing interesting information on plot, mass.txt data for ex3,
and squarewave.py, which is an edited version of the existing scipy.signal.square to yield
appropriate values for V_in in ex6. 


Problem 1:
-----------
Run ex1.py
Calculates T/T_0 as a function of angle and plots comparison to more exact elliptical
integral in scipy.special


Problem 2:
-----------
Run ex2.py
Generates pixel map showing Julia set for c = -0.79+.56i

Problem 3:
-----------
Run ex3.py
Reads mass.txt in as numpy array and plots a histogram of the data

Problem 4:
-----------
Run ex4.py
Takes 16 bit integer as input and converts specific bunches of bits to useful data


Problem 5:
-----------
Run ex5.py
Uses bisection method to solve x*cos(x)=1/2

Problem 6:
-----------
Run ex6.py
Uses Runge_Kutta method to plot solutions to differential equation from 0<t<10 and 90<t<100 microseconds.
Takes time constant as user input. X out first graph to see second.
