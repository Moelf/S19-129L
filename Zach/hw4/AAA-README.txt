Using standard version of python and packages that all the RPis use in this class
A dataset and ccHiststuff are provided in addition to problem solutions


Problem 1:
-----------
Run ex1.py
Opens the given dataset and plots it using an appropriate log scale

Problem 2:
-----------
Run ex2.py
Using provided genPoisson.py, makes appropriate edits to introduce noise in mean
as well as allow for gaussian or lognormal using different input switches

Problem 3:
-----------
Run ex3.py
Performs MC integration of given problem

Problem 4:
-----------
Run ex4.py
Same as problem 3, but generates points using markov chain method instead of totally random

Problem 5:
-----------
Run ex5.py
Plots a function while applying MC integration techniques
