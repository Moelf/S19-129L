Problem 1:
-----------
Run ex1.py
Gives two histograms. The first one has both X1-X0 and X2-X0 on the same graph
while the second has Xav-X0.

Problem 2:
-----------
Run ex2.py
Constructed a chi-squared regression according to an exponential function using
Campagnari's definition and procedure outlined in the problem and notes. Superimposes
the fitted function on the histogram of the raw data and prints the parameters P0 and P1.

Problem 3:
-----------
Run ex3.py
Similar to problem 1, but fits the two tracks simultaneously and calculates the pull
as well. Plots Xf-X0 and then the pull (Xf-X0)/Xf also.
