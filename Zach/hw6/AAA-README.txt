Using Python 3.5.3 and standard packages on the RPi
Comes with LVector_specification.py provided by Campagnari

Problem 1:
-----------
Constructed a 4-Vector class contained within LVector.py, with all the required methods described in LVector_specification.py. When running LVector_specification.py, all the methods function appropriately.

Problem 2:
-----------
Run ex2.py
Takes N, mu, and sigma as float inputs greater than zero.
For N=5, mu=3, sigma=.5: CL limit=7.65
For N=1, mu=3, sigma=.5: CL limit=3.56

Problem 3:
-----------
Run ex3.py
Takes N, mu, and sigma as float inputs greater than zero.
For N=5, mu=3, sigma=.5: CL limit=5.93
For N=1, mu=3, sigma=.5: CL limit=0.01

Problem 4:
-----------
Run ex4.py
Plots contour plot of the square of a wavefunction, normalized to have the maximum be one.
